###  Exploring  bike share systems for three major cities in the United States.

This is a repository for a  Bikeshare project. It has a  python code file  that imports data from a dataset of a bikeshare system of 3 cities in USA â€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing descriptive statistics . Also the code  creates an interactive  user experience in the terminal to present these statistics to the user based on their inputs. Details of the project are as follows:


__In this project the data sets used were:__

-chicago.csv

-new_york_city.csv

-washington.csv

__To complete this project the general software used were:__
1.  Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
3. A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

__The 4 basic questions that were asked for user inputs were:__
